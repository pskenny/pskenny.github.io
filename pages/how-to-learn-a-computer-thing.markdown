What is it? Programming language, framework, library, technology, concept? Do you want practical knowledge or general knowledge?

## From Scratch

Find resources to start. Books, search for tutorials, YouTube videos. There's lots of beginner material because there's lots of people that have been beginners. There's more beginner knowledge out there than expert knowledge.

## Not From Scratch

Get up to speed. At first just as much as you have to to be dangerous. Find out what things are and, sometime more importantly, what they are not.
