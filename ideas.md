A few free ideas for projects:

### r/listentothis System Tray Player

Takes top posts links from [r/listentothis](https://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/) and plays on the desktop system tray.

Additional features:

- Download current track and add audio file locally e.g. through [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) or [spotdl](https://github.com/ritiek/spotify-downloader)
- Copy link to clipboard

### Markdown To Wallpaper

Display contents of a Markdown file as the wallpaper of your desktop. Use case: your todo list file is now your wallpaper.

Additional features:

- Different styles
- Autostart on login option
- Regenerate on file changes

### RSS-to-Podcast Service

Get text content of RSS links items, put through [Readability](https://github.com/mozilla/readability), [text summarisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_summarization) and a [TTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis) engine to generate an mp3. Generate a podcast RSS feed and add timestamps in the RSS item description to skip (some podcast clients support this e.g. [AntennaPod](https://antennapod.org/)).
