A few free ideas for projects:

### r/listentothis Tray Icon Player

Takes top posts link from [r/listentothis](https://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/) and plays on the desktop system tray.

Additional features:

-  Download current track and add music locally e.g. through [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) or [spotdl](https://github.com/ritiek/spotify-downloader)

### Timer Service API

Share timers (e.g. alarms for waking up) over network to a clients (computer or phone).

### Music Artist Release Notifier

Check online databases against artists in local music library ID3 tags for new releases of work and notify user. See [Wikipedia's list of online music databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_online_music_databases).

Additional features:

- Check if there is a significant portion of an artist music and automatically detect new releases by that artist (as well as ones defined by user)

### Shazam But It Adds To Local Music Library

Listens to audio, finds out what song it is (see [acoustic fingerprinting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_fingerprint)), checks Spotify and adds it to your music library. Example: finds song metadata, finds it on Youtube, asks if it can get it as MP3 and put it in filesystem.
