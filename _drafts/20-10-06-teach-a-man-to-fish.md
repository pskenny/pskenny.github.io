title: "Teaching A Man To Fish: Getting Started With Fish"
---

_tldr:_ [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) feels great to use. Give is a go. Looks good, easy to script and fun to play around with. You can even [try it in your browser](https://rootnroll.com/d/fish-shell/).

Why use Fish? Most Linux systems come with Bash or Dash but there are friendlier shells. Introducing the __f__riendly __i__nteractive __sh__ell, _fish_.

Features like autosuggestions, tab completions and syntax highlighting are great for command discoverability and writing commands less erroneously (sometimes). I find the syntax of Fish more appealing and straight forward than Bash too (but I'll get into that further on).

_Note:_ I am assuming from here on you have Fish [installed and running](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html#installation) on your machine.

### Plugins

We'll use [Oh My Fish!](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish) as a plugin manager. 

### Shell Prompt

One of the popular and portable shell prompts is [Starship](https://github.com/starship/starship).

### Functions

Writing functions is a handy way of doing things the Unix way. For example, I want a script to keep my my local Git projects up to date with their repositories. It's not a complicated enough task to require you to require sitting down with a compiler, it can easily be done in a simple function so let's write one.
