This is a digital garden and [exobrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externalism). It's my area to write notes, instructions, blog posts, ideas and curate, all while sharing.

It's split in two: pages and posts.

**Pages** are a generic term for my personal notes, resources and thoughts. These are liable to change at any time with my own passing thoughts. No page is in a "final" state, all are works-in-progress.

**Posts** refer to blog posts. Pointed thinking that is fairly isolated from the other information on this website and are generally not editted once released.
