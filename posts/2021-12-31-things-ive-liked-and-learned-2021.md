## Podcasts

- [Lex Fridman Podcast](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/) - Smart people having long conversations with Lex. Spoken with empathy and a generous understanding. Although long (usually 2.5/3 hours), I've never regretted listening to a minute.
- [CoRecursive](https://corecursive.com/) - Interviews with tech people, programmer oriented. Consistently interesting.

## Films/TV Shows/YouTube

- [The Midnight Gospel](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11639414/) - Gentle existential conversations with bright, playful and reflective visuals.
- [Patrick (H) Willems](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF1fG3gT44nGTPU2sVLoFWg) - Someone who loves and knows a lot about film making talks about films.

## Books
